    "In **Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA)**, the first step is to create segments—this means breaking the image down into small groups of pixels that are next to each other and have similar properties. Once we have these segments, we can classify them and adjust the groups as needed. OBIA differs from traditional pixel-based methods by focusing on these segments rather than individual pixels, which brings several advantages:\n",
    "* **Smoother classifications**: Grouping similar pixels helps avoid noisy results, which can sometimes look like random scattered dots (commonly called the \"salt-and-pepper effect\").\n",
    "* **Better object detection**: It's easier to count and analyze objects when they are represented as segments rather than individual pixels.\n",
    "* **More features to describe objects**: By working with segments, we can use extra information, such as shape and texture, to better describe the objects.\n",
    "* **Improved performance**: Fewer individual observations are needed, which speeds up the processing.\n",

    "SLIC is a segmentation algorithm that divides an image into compact, nearly uniform segments called *superpixels*. These superpixels are groups of pixels with similar color or intensity values, which generally align with the boundaries of objects in the image. SLIC is popular because it is efficient and produces visually coherent segments. The algorithm clusters pixels based on both their spatial proximity and color similarity, using the k-means algorithm to group them into superpixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Parameters:**\n",
    "* **Number of Superpixels:**  Controls how many segments are created in the image. Fewer superpixels result in larger segments, while more superpixels produce smaller, more detailed segments.\n",
    "* **Compactness:** Adjusts the balance between color similarity and spatial proximity. Higher values produce more compact, evenly spaced superpixels, while lower values allow for more irregular shapes that better capture color variations\n",

    "Neural network (NN)-based segmentation is a broad field that includes various approaches such as semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation. In the context of deep learning, semantic segmentation refers to pixel-level labeling, while instance and panoptic segmentation are used to delineate distinct, spatially contiguous regions. NN-based models use a series of non-linear functions to analyze both image intensity and spatial context, learning from large sets of annotated training images to segment new images in a supervised, data-driven manner. Once trained, these models can be applied in an unsupervised manner without needing parameter adjustments.\n",

    "A notable approach released in 2023 is Segment Anything (SAM), which enables instance segmentation with minimal input (zero-/few-shot learning). SAM is built on a vision transformer architecture and has been trained on over 11 million images across multiple domains, making it a \"foundation model\" with strong generalization abilities, even in previously unseen domains like remote sensing imagery. Although SAM is not demonstrated in this notebook due to its complexity and GPU requirements, you can explore it using the [segment-geospatial](https://samgeo.gishub.org/installation/) package."
